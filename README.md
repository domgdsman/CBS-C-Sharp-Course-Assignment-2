# CBS Introduction to Programming and Application Design (C#)

###### This is the second mandatory assignment of the course.

Three reflection points about the assignment:

- Arrays are much less flexible than in JavaScript due to the fact, that I need to declare the type, and length of the array. I later found out, that there are Lists and the List.Add() method (equivalent to the Array.push() method) and the possibility of converting lists into arrays.
- I also learned about the static and public/private attributes of classes, and the two ways of creating objects: setting a static class or using the class constructor (maybe there are other ways I have not found out about yet). I was then struggling to find out the syntax for a class constructor at first, but then found it on the Microsoft documentation.
- It is still unclear to me, why the class and all it's properties have to be set to public individually to access them from the Main method. Shouldn't it be enough to set the class to public?
